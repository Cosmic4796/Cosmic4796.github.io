        <h1>Fun.Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 26, 2023</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Fun.Bot ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Discord bot, Fun.Bot (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Fun.Bot collects minimal data necessary to provide its services. The types of information we may collect include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server IDs and Channel IDs:</strong> To identify where commands are used and to properly respond within specific servers and channels. This data is used for operational purposes only (e.g., storing configuration for features like custom prefixes or welcome messages) and is not linked to individual users.</li>
            <li><strong>User IDs (for specific features):</strong> In cases where a feature requires identifying a user (e.g., tracking scores in a game, moderation actions), Fun.Bot may temporarily or persistently store User IDs. This data is used solely for the functionality of that specific feature and is not shared with third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous statistics on command usage (e.g., how often a command is used) may be collected to help us understand feature popularity and improve the bot. This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users or their specific actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do NOT collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discord messages content (unless explicitly part of a command, which is processed in real-time and not stored).</li>
            <li>Personal information such as your real name, email address, or IP address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate and provide the features of Fun.Bot.</li>
            <li>To improve and optimize Fun.Bot's performance and functionality.</li>
            <li>To understand how Fun.Bot is used (through aggregated, anonymized data).</li>
            <li>To enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through Fun.Bot from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Data is stored on secure servers and access is restricted to authorized personnel only. While we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
        <p>Data such as Server IDs and User IDs (where applicable) may be stored as long as Fun.Bot is active on a server or as long as necessary for the functioning of a specific feature. Upon removal of Fun.Bot from a server, associated server data will be deleted within a reasonable timeframe, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. We may share aggregated, anonymized usage data with third-party services for analytics purposes, but this data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Fun.Bot may interact with Discord's API to provide its features. Your use of Discord is subject to Discord's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the practices of Discord or any other third-party services.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>By removing Fun.Bot from your Discord server, you will stop all further data collection by the bot for that server. If you have concerns about specific data associated with your User ID (e.g., game scores), please contact us using the information below.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our Discord support server (if available) or via [Your Contact Email/Method Here].</p>
